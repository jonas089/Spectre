# Running smart contract integration tests
When running the Spectre smart contract integration tests, replace this crate with [this crate](https://github.com/ChainSafe/spectre-contracts/tree/a430caeb3678582b73e3ee73b6f001bd9d1e75ca)

Additionally make sure to enable the `contracts` feature when running tests against the real contracts crate.

/*
    As a user looking to run contract integration tests it is recommended
    that you delete this crate (the 'contracts' crate) and replace it with
    the contracts crate found here:

    https://github.com/ChainSafe/spectre-contracts/tree/a430caeb3678582b73e3ee73b6f001bd9d1e75ca

    To run the contract integration tests afterwards, run:

    cargo test -- --features contracts
*/
